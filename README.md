# Yarn Multi-Scale Model in Mitsuba 3
This branch contains the initial code for our paper: "A Multi-scale Yarn Appearance Model with Fiber Details"

## Building Mitsuba 3
Please use the provided Mitsuba 3 base folder to build Mitsuba 3 so that the Mitsuba version is same as what we had used. The buil instructions can be found [here](https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/developer_guide/compiling.html). Our build was done on Ubuntu 21.1.

## Running the file
After setting up the Mitsuba 3, run the jupyter notebook to create the rendering of a simple scene with two yarns, one horizontal and one vertical, each having three plies.

## TODOs
- Add documentation for each step of the code.
- Add code for all the scenes in the paper.
